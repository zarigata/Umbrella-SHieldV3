# ZariVirusKiller Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the ZariVirusKiller project based on the current state of the codebase and the requirements specified in the building plan.

## Current State Analysis

After reviewing the codebase, we have identified the following components that are already implemented:

### Client-side
- Basic UI with custom styling and pastel colors
- ScanEngine with basic file scanning capabilities
- License verification system
- Update mechanism for virus definitions

### Server-side
- Flask API with endpoints for license verification, virus definition distribution, and file scanning
- Database models for license keys, definition updates, and virus signatures
- Basic file upload and scanning functionality

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Complete Client-side Scanning Engine

#### 1.1 Enhance File Scanning Capabilities
- Implement pattern-based scanning for larger files
- Add heuristic analysis for detecting unknown threats
- Implement quarantine functionality for infected files

#### 1.2 Improve Real-time Protection
- Implement file system monitoring using FileSystemWatcher
- Add process monitoring for suspicious activities
- Create hooks for scanning files before they are opened

#### 1.3 Enhance Update Mechanism
- Implement automatic background updates
- Add signature verification for downloaded definition files
- Create a local database for storing scan history

### 2. Complete Server-side Components

#### 2.1 Enhance API Endpoints
- Complete the implementation of the `/add-signature` endpoint
- Add authentication for admin endpoints
- Implement rate limiting and security measures

#### 2.2 Update Database Schema
- Add missing fields to the `virus_signature` table
- Create tables for scan statistics and user activity
- Implement proper indexing for performance

#### 2.3 Create Admin Dashboard
- Implement TypeScript/Tailwind web interface
- Create views for license management, virus definition management, and statistics
- Add user authentication and authorization

### 3. Integration and Testing

#### 3.1 Client-Server Integration
- Ensure proper communication between client and server
- Test license verification flow
- Validate definition update process

#### 3.2 Testing
- Create unit tests for core components
- Implement integration tests for client-server interaction
- Perform security testing

### 4. Deployment and Distribution

#### 4.1 Client Deployment
- Create installer using NSIS or WiX
- Implement automatic updates for the client application
- Add proper error handling and logging

#### 4.2 Server Deployment
- Complete Docker configuration
- Create deployment scripts
- Implement backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Complete client-side scanning engine and real-time protection
2. **Week 2**: Enhance server-side API and database
3. **Week 3**: Implement admin dashboard
4. **Week 4**: Integration, testing, and deployment

## Next Steps

1. Implement pattern-based scanning in the ScanEngine
2. Complete the virus signature management in the server
3. Create the admin dashboard web interface
4. Implement quarantine functionality
5. Enhance real-time protection

This implementation plan will be updated as progress is made on the project.
