# ZariVirusKiller Master Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document serves as the master roadmap for implementing the ZariVirusKiller antivirus solution. It integrates all the individual implementation guides and provides a clear path forward for completing the project.

## Project Status

The ZariVirusKiller project currently has the following components partially implemented:

- **Client Application**: Basic UI, scanning engine with hash-based detection, license verification
- **Server API**: Basic endpoints for license verification, virus definition distribution, and file scanning
- **Database**: Initial schema for license keys and definition updates

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Scanning Engine Enhancement (Week 1)

**Objective**: Complete the client-side scanning engine with advanced detection capabilities.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement pattern-based scanning for detecting malware variants
   - Create pattern definition format
   - Implement Boyer-Moore algorithm for pattern matching
   - Support both fixed and variable offset patterns

2. Add heuristic analysis for unknown threats
   - Analyze suspicious API calls in executables
   - Implement entropy analysis for detecting packed/encrypted malware
   - Create a risk scoring system

3. Implement quarantine functionality
   - Create secure quarantine location
   - Implement file encryption for quarantined files
   - Add methods for quarantining, restoring, and deleting files

**Reference**: See [Scanning Engine Implementation Guide](scanning_engine_implementation.md) for detailed instructions.

### Phase 2: Real-Time Protection (Week 1-2)

**Objective**: Implement robust real-time protection to prevent malware execution.

**Tasks**:
1. Create file system monitoring
   - Implement FileSystemWatcher for tracking file operations
   - Add scan queue and processing thread
   - Implement exclusion system

2. Add process monitoring
   - Use WMI to monitor process creation
   - Scan new executables before they run
   - Implement process termination for malicious programs

3. Integrate as Windows service
   - Create service installation and configuration
   - Implement service control from UI
   - Add self-protection mechanisms

**Reference**: See [Real-Time Protection Implementation Guide](realtime_protection_implementation.md) for detailed instructions.

### Phase 3: Server API Completion (Week 2)

**Objective**: Enhance the server-side API with all required functionality.

**Tasks**:
1. Implement authentication system
   - Add JWT-based authentication for admin endpoints
   - Secure all administrative functions

2. Complete virus signature management
   - Enhance the `/add-signature` endpoint to support pattern-based signatures
   - Implement batch operations for signature management

3. Add license management features
   - Implement batch license generation
   - Add license validation and reporting

4. Update database schema
   - Add support for pattern-based signatures
   - Create tables for scan statistics and user activity

**Reference**: See [Server Implementation Guide](server_implementation.md) for detailed instructions.

### Phase 4: Admin Dashboard (Week 3)

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive web dashboard for administration.

**Tasks**:
1. Set up TypeScript/Tailwind project
   - Initialize project structure
   - Configure build system

2. Implement dashboard pages
   - Create login page with authentication
   - Implement license management interface
   - Add virus definition management
   - Create statistics and reporting views

3. Integrate with server API
   - Create API service for communication
   - Implement data fetching and state management
   - Add real-time updates where appropriate

**Reference**: See [Server Implementation Guide](server_implementation.md) for detailed instructions on the admin dashboard.

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing (Week 4)

**Objective**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly and reliably.

**Tasks**:
1. Client-server integration testing
   - Test license verification flow
   - Validate definition update process
   - Verify file scanning with server verification

2. Performance testing
   - Measure scanning performance with different file sizes
   - Test real-time protection impact on system resources
   - Optimize critical paths

3. Security testing
   - Test with EICAR test files
   - Attempt to bypass protection mechanisms
   - Verify quarantine effectiveness

### Phase 6: Deployment Preparation (Week 4)

**Objective**: Prepare both client and server components for deployment.

**Tasks**:
1. Create client installer
   - Configure WiX for MSI generation
   - Implement service installation
   - Add code signing

2. Set up server deployment
   - Finalize Docker configuration
   - Create deployment scripts
   - Implement backup and recovery procedures

3. Documentation
   - Update user documentation
   - Create administrator guide
   - Document API endpoints

**Reference**: See [Deployment Guide](deployment_guide.md) for detailed instructions.

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Create feature branch from main
   - Implement feature according to relevant guide
   - Write unit tests
   - Submit pull request

2. **Code Review**:
   - Verify implementation against requirements
   - Check for security issues
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Validate test coverage

3. **Integration**:
   - Merge approved pull requests to main
   - Run integration tests
   - Deploy to staging environment

4. **Release**:
   - Tag release version
   - Build production artifacts
   - Deploy to production
   - Monitor for issues

## Success Criteria

The ZariVirusKiller project will be considered complete when:

1. The client application can detect and quarantine malware using both hash-based and pattern-based methods
2. Real-time protection effectively prevents malware execution
3. The server API provides secure license management and definition distribution
4. The admin dashboard allows comprehensive management of the system
5. All components are properly documented and ready for deployment

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of the enhanced scanning engine (Phase 1)
2. Set up the development environment for all team members
3. Create detailed task assignments based on this roadmap
4. Schedule regular progress reviews

This roadmap will be updated as the project progresses to reflect current status and any changes in requirements or priorities.
