# ZariVirusKiller Implementation Documentation

Welcome to the ZariVirusKiller implementation documentation. This directory contains comprehensive guides and plans for implementing the complete ZariVirusKiller antivirus solution with client-server architecture.

## Documentation Overview

### Master Implementation Roadmap

The [Master Implementation Roadmap](master_implementation_roadmap.md) provides a high-level overview of the entire implementation process, divided into phases with clear objectives and tasks. This should be your starting point for understanding the project implementation plan.

### Detailed Implementation Guides

1. [Scanning Engine Implementation](scanning_engine_implementation.md) - Detailed guide for implementing the core virus scanning engine with pattern-based detection, heuristic analysis, and quarantine functionality.

2. [Real-Time Protection Implementation](realtime_protection_implementation.md) - Instructions for implementing file system monitoring, process monitoring, and Windows service integration for continuous protection.

3. [Server Implementation](server_implementation.md) - Guide for completing the server-side components, including API endpoints, database schema, and admin dashboard.

4. [Deployment Guide](deployment_guide.md) - Comprehensive instructions for deploying both client and server components, including installer creation, server configuration, and maintenance procedures.

### Project Planning

1. [Building Plan](building_plan.md) - The original building plan that outlines the project structure and high-level requirements.

2. [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) - Analysis of the current state and detailed tasks for completing the project.
