# Scanning Engine Implementation Guide

This document provides detailed implementation instructions for enhancing the ZariVirusKiller scanning engine with advanced detection capabilities.

## Overview

The current scanning engine has basic functionality for hash-based detection and server verification. We need to enhance it with:

1. Pattern-based scanning for detecting malware variants
2. Heuristic analysis for unknown threats
3. Quarantine functionality for infected files
4. Improved real-time protection

## Implementation Details

### 1. Pattern-Based Scanning

#### File Structure

Create a new pattern definition format that includes:

```json
{
  "signatures": [
    {
      "id": "ZARI-001",
      "name": "Trojan.Generic",
      "severity": "high",
      "patterns": [
        {
          "type": "hex",
          "value": "4D5A9000",
          "offset": "0"
        },
        {
          "type": "ascii",
          "value": "CreateRemoteThread",
          "offset": "any"
        }
      ],
      "logic": "all"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Implementation Steps

1. Extend the `ScanEngine.cs` to support pattern matching:
   - Add a new method `ScanFileWithPatterns` that reads files in chunks
   - Implement Boyer-Moore or similar algorithm for efficient pattern matching
   - Support both fixed offset and "any" offset patterns

2. Update the definition loader to handle pattern-based signatures:
   - Modify `InitializeAsync` to load both hash-based and pattern-based signatures
   - Create a structured format for storing patterns in memory

### 2. Heuristic Analysis

Implement basic heuristic detection by analyzing:

1. Suspicious API calls in executables
2. Entropy analysis for detecting packed/encrypted malware
3. Behavioral indicators like file operations in suspicious locations

#### Implementation Steps

1. Create a `HeuristicScanner` class that:
   - Analyzes PE headers for executables
   - Calculates file entropy
   - Checks for suspicious strings or code patterns

2. Assign a risk score based on multiple factors

### 3. Quarantine Functionality

#### Implementation Steps

1. Create a secure quarantine location:
   ```csharp
   string quarantinePath = Path.Combine(
       Environment.GetFolderPath(Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData),
       "ZariVirusKiller", "Quarantine");
   ```

2. Implement file encryption for quarantined files:
   - Encrypt the file with AES
   - Store original path and metadata in a separate index file

3. Add methods for:
   - Quarantining files: `QuarantineFile(string filePath)`
   - Restoring files: `RestoreFile(string quarantineId, string destinationPath)`
   - Deleting quarantined files: `DeleteQuarantinedFile(string quarantineId)`

### 4. Real-Time Protection

#### Implementation Steps

1. Create a `RealTimeScanner` class that:
   - Uses `FileSystemWatcher` to monitor file system changes
   - Scans files when they are created or modified
   - Blocks access to infected files

2. Implement process monitoring:
   - Monitor process creation using WMI events
   - Scan new executables before they run

3. Add system integration:
   - Register as a Windows service
   - Start automatically at system boot

## Integration with Existing Code

1. Update the `ScanEngine` class to use the new scanning methods
2. Modify the UI to display quarantine management options
3. Add settings for configuring real-time protection

## Performance Considerations

1. Implement multi-threading for scanning large directories
2. Use memory-mapped files for scanning large files
3. Cache frequently accessed files and scan results
4. Implement scan exclusions for trusted locations

## Testing Strategy

1. Create a test suite with known malware patterns (EICAR test file)
2. Measure scanning performance with different file sizes
3. Test real-time protection with file operations
4. Validate quarantine and restore functionality

## Next Steps

After implementing these enhancements, we should:

1. Update the server-side API to support pattern-based signatures
2. Implement a signature creation tool for the admin dashboard
3. Add telemetry for improving detection rates

This implementation will significantly enhance the detection capabilities of ZariVirusKiller while maintaining good performance.
